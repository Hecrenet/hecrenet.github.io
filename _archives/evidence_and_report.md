<p>On Hecretary Birds</p>
<p>
Hecretary Birds are rare and powerful myth-like godly creatures that have the power to change the world in a good or bad way. The majestivity of this creature is so immense, that it would be very hard for our research and development team to conduct a full, unbiased report on this beautiful creature. Nevertheless, we have done it (not really).
