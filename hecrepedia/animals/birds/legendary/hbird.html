			//Breif Description
			"The Hecretary Bird is a creature of whom the greatest cannot be described with mere words. The Creator of The Rest of The Universe, The Majestic One, The Greaterestest One, the Hecretary Bird goes by many names. It is our master and benefactor.",
			//Personality
			"Whilst the Snaxe followers claim the great bird to be lazy, the protagonist, spoilt, and evil, we can only agree with them on that the Hecretary Bird is the protagonist. The Hecretary Bird is a hard-worker, defender of the innocent, the best at Snaxing, bringer of peace, and many more. The Hecretary Bird is a bad role model because unlike us humans, it is perfect.",

			//Birth
			"Sadly, we do not know the true origin because our predecessors decided to pass down stuff orally, even when they had the technology! One bozo messed up the impeccable story by one word, and there are many variations of the story. We like to use two common ones, the latter one being not used much at all.</p><hr><h3>R Version</h3><p>A few million years after the formation of the Earth, some creatures moved to Earth from a distant planet(at the time, the distant Hecretary Planet, the Distant Snaxe Planet, the Earth, Heaven, and the Underworld were the only things in the Universe). These creatures, known as Hecretary Birds, had been in existence since the time before time. On Earth, they moved to an enchanted island which they named Hecretary. 5 days later, other creatures named Snaxii(also in existence since the time before time) came to Earth. However, they were more ambitious than the Hecretary Birds and took over the rest of the Earth. These Snaxii were not genetically diverse and only had 2 species in their genus. The Hecretary Birds wanted to fight back against the Snaxii, but realized they were outnumbered. They decided to wage a proxy war, one where only the Hecretary Leader and Snaxe Leader would fight to the death. The Hecretary leader, Hecrusander the Great, went to meet the Snaxe Leader, The Evil Snaxe, on the Dust Desert. Then, the battle started. The creatures went to war, skillfully maneuvering around Heaven and the Underworld to attack each other. After 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the Evil Snaxe was kicked by a powerful leg of Hecrusander. Before he died and turned into shapeless pulp, however, he used his Time-Stalin powers and laid a single egg. He then un-Time-Stalined the battle and used the last of his energy to bite Hecrusander’s legs. The Evil Snaxe then died. Hecrusander was carried off the battlefield like a hero and returned to his loyal subjects. He died shortly afterward, however, because of weak legs. These weak legs have been found in almost every future H-Bird and are the basis of the Leg-Snapping Syndrome. In the victory celebrations, the H-Birds forgot about the Evil Snaxe’s egg. Surprisingly, this egg hatched into 4 individual major Snaxii, who are the Bing Snake, the Yiper, the Sea Dragon Snaxe, and the iSnaxe. They diversified the Snaxe Evolutionary Tree with many new minor Snaxii, including Sea Snaxii and Sky Snaxii.</p><hr><h3>M Version</h3><p>In a time before time but with time, there was (still is) a distant planet in the Part of The Universe. Two colossal beings lived on this planet. These two beings were the Hecretary Bird and the Evil Snaxe, known also as the Snaxe (The Snaxe refers to all non-Evil Snaxe). The Snaxe lived in the desert, where it was forever waiting for the Hecretary Bird to land there so it could kill it. Sadly, both beings are immortal, but can be injured to a point worse than death. Other than this distant planet, there was nothing else, so the Hecretary Bird decided that a universe should be made. It also decided that it needed to think before creating the universe. To get to a good thinking spot, the Hecretary Bird flew under the Underworld to get to Heaven. After reaching Heaven, the Hecretary Bird flew up into the belly of the Snaxe and came out of the belly because the Snaxe had lung indigestion. The Snaxe was extremely surprised, until it realized that now was its moment to get revenge. The Hecretary Bird starting thinking, but then realized that it had to defeat the Evil Snaxe first. A fierce battle engaged between the two which lasted for 2 minutes and 30 seconds. The Hecretary Bird won, but at a price. Near the end of the war… the Snaxe bit the Hecretary Bird’s leg, and it hurt a lot. The Hecretary Bird wasn’t able to shake off the Snaxe until major damage had inflicted its legs. Now there is a phenomenon known as leg-snapping which incurs in the Hecretary Bird and all of the people of whom which the Hecretary Bird was a predecessor. When the Hecretary Bird runs, its legs will snap (The name wasn’t obvious so we starved an entire team to discover what it meant). Using its claws, the Hecretary Bird tried to transform the Snaxe into shapeless pulp, but an effort in vain since the Evil Snaxe simply split into two. The Snaxe of the Head and the Snaxe of Everything but the Head. These two Snaxii split again, creating all the Major and Minor Snaxii that are known today. The Hecretary Bird was now ready to create the Rest of The Universe. Using its great power, it did it in a, no pun intended (it would be a grave mistake), Snap! But, the Hecretary Bird created it so fast and the Rest of The Universe acted as a magnet and all the Snaxii went to a planet, which we call “Earth”. The Hecretary Bird’s job for now was complete, but only if it had created the Rest of The Universe first before thinking about it.",
