			//Breif Description
			"The Hecretary Bird is a creature of whom the greatest cannot be described with mere words. The Creator of The Rest of The Universe, The Majestic One, The Greaterestest One, the Hecretary Bird goes by many names. It is our master and benefactor.",
			//Personality
			"Whilist the Snaxii followers claim the great bid to be lazy, the protagonist, spoilt, and evil, we can only agree that the Hecretary Bird is the protagonist. The Hecretary Bird is a hard-worker, defender of the innocent, the best at Snaxing, bringer of peace, and you get the fact. The Hecretary Bird is a bad role model because unlike us humans, it is perfect.",

			"Sadly, we do not know the true origin because our predecessors decided to pass down stuff orally, even when they had the technology! One bozo messed up the impeccable story by one word, and there are many variations of the story. We like to use two common ones, the latter one being not used much at all.</p><hr><h3>R Version</h3><p>A few million years after the formation of the Earth, some creatures moved to Earth from a distant planet(at the time, the distant Hecretary Planet, the Distant Snaxe Planet, the Earth, Heaven, and the Underworld were the only things in the Universe). These creatures, known as Hecretary Birds, had been in existence since the time before time. On Earth, they moved to an enchanted island which they named Hecretary. 5 days later, other creatures named Snaxii(also in existence since the time before time) came to Earth. However, they were more ambitious than the Hecretary Birds and took over the rest of the Earth. These Snaxii were not genetically diverse and only had 2 species in their genus. The Hecretary Birds wanted to fight back against the Snaxii, but realized they were outnumbered. They decided to wage a proxy war, one where only the Hecretary Leader and Snaxe Leader would fight to the death. The Hecretary leader, Hecrusander the Great, went to meet the Snaxe Leader, The Evil Snaxe, on the Dust Desert. Then, the battle started. The creatures went to war, skillfully maneuvering around Heaven and the Underworld to attack each other. After 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the Evil Snaxe was kicked by a powerful leg of Hecrusander. Before he died and turned into shapeless pulp, however, he used his Time-Stalin powers and laid a single egg. He then un-Time-Stalined the battle and used the last of his energy to bite Hecrusander’s legs. The Evil Snaxe then died. Hecrusander was carried off the battlefield like a hero and returned to his loyal subjects. He died shortly afterward, however, because of weak legs. These weak legs have been found in almost every future H-Bird and are the basis of the Leg-Snapping Syndrome. In the victory celebrations, the H-Birds forgot about the Evil Snaxe’s egg. Surprisingly, this egg hatched into 4 individual major Snaxii, who are the Bing Snake, the Yiper, the Sea Dragon Snaxe, and the iSnaxe. They diversified the Snaxe Evolutionary Tree with many new minor Snaxii, including Sea Snaxii and Sky Snaxii.</p><hr><h3>M Version</h3><p>",
