			//Breif Description
			"The Bearded Snaxe is notorius for its vicious beard. Foes also never expect it to take flight. The Bearded Snaxe has the appearance of a common Snaxe with a beard. It is also very stylish and is seen wearing very refined accessories.",
			//Personality
			"All Bearded Snaxii have a split personality. One can usually predict the personality of the Snaxe, but no one can predict the personality of the beard.</p><h2>Snaxe</h2><hr><p>The Snaxe, if you may, of a Bearded Snaxe tend to be socially shy with other species and prefer hanging around with each other.  For some unknown reasons, these Snaxii like to wage war agaisnt crows at local <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco'>Costcos</a>, which can lead to people thinking that it's night already. When these Snaxii are not warriors, they prefer to just exist and not do anything. The conflict of their personality is what lands them in the moderately dangerous category. They are also very stylish, and can be compared to <a href='http://splatoon.wikia.com/wiki/Inklings'>Inklings</a> from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatoon'>Splatoon</a>. Don't sue us, Nintendo, we don't have any money.</p><h2>Beard</h2><hr><p>The beard is mysterious and unique to the Bearded Snaxii. It has a mind of its own and is very agressive. So agressive are they, that the Bearded Snaxii have invented a special muzzle for their beards, but their laziness prevents them from using it. It is very rare, if not impossible, to see a Bearded Snaxe that has a good relationship with its beard. Many of the beards of the Bearded Snaxii like to forcefully lift their masters into the sky, which is why Bearded Snaxii are great warriors, since they know how to channel their anger. Beards of the Bearded Snaxii are not afreaid, even of being shaved. This is because they cannot be shaved. (This remains true for a female Bearded Snaxe)",
