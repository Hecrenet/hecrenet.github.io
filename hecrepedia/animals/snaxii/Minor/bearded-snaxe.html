			<h2>Personality Problem</h2>
			<p>All Bearded Snaxii have a split personality. One can usually predict the personality of the Snaxe, but no one can predict the personality of its beard.</p>

		<div class="section right" style="animation-delay: 0.25s">
			<h2>The Snaxe</h2>
			<p>The Snaxe, if you may, of a Bearded Snaxe tend to be socially shy with other species, and prefer hanging around with each other.</p>
			<p>For some unknown reasons, these Snaxii like to wage war agaisnt crows at local <a href="#">Costcos</a>, which can lead to people thinking it's night already</p>
			<p>When these Snaxii are not warriors, they prefer to just be there and not do anything. The conflict of their personality is what lands them in the moderately dangerous categoryr</p>
			<p>They are also very stylish, and can be compared to <a href="#">Squidlings</a> from <a href="#">Splatoon</a>. Don't sue us Nintendo, we don't have any money.

		<div class="section left" style="animation-delay: 0.5s">
			<h2>The Beard</h2>
			<p>The beard is mysterious and unique to the Bearded Snaxii. It has a mind of it's own and it is are very agressive. So agressive they are, that the Bearded Snaxii have invented a special muzzle for their beards, but their laziness prevents them from using it.</p>
			<p>It is rare to see a Bearded Snaxii that has a good relationship with their beard. Many of the beards of Bearded Snaxe like to forcefully lift their masters into the sky, which is why Bearded Snaxii are great warriors, since they know how to channel their anger.</p>
			<p>Beards of Bearded Snaxii aren't afraid, even of being shaved off, mainly because they can't be shaved. (This is true for a female Bearded Snaxe)</p>
