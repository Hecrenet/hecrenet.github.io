				<h2>Personality Problem</h2>
				<p>All Bearded Snaxe have a split personality. One can usually predict the personality of the Snaxe, but no one can predict the personality of its beard.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="section" class="right">
				<h2>The Snaxe</h2>
				<p>The Snaxe, if you may, of a Bearded Snaxe tend to be socially shy with other species, and prefer hanging around with each other.</p>
				<p>For some unknown reasons, these Snaxii like to wage war agaisnt crows at local <a href="#">Costcos</a>, which can lead to people thinking it's night already</p>
				<p>When these Snaxii are not warriors, they prefer to just be there and not do anything. The conflict of their personality is what lands them in the moderately dangerous categoryr</p>
				<p>They are also very stylish, and can be compared to <a href="#">Squidlings</a> from <a href="#">Splatoon</a>. Don't sue us Nintendo, we don't have any money.

			<div id="section" class="left">
				<h2>The Beard</h2>
				<p>The beard is mysterious and unique to Beard Snaxii. It has a mind of it's own and they are very agressive. So agressive they are, that the Bearded Snaxe have invented a special muzzle for their beards, but their laziness prevents them from using it.</p>
				<p>It is rare to see a Beard Snaxe that has a good relationship with their beard. Many of the beards of Beard Snaxe like to forcefully lift their masters into the sky, which is why Beard Snaxe are great warriors, since they know how to channel their anger.</p>
				<p>Beards of Beard Snaxe aren't afraid, even of being shaved off, mainly because they can't be shaved. (This is true for a female beard snaxe)</p>
