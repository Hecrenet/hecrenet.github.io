				<h2>Appearance</h2>
				<p>The Hecretary bird is a pretty ordinary looking bird. Since we Humans are not normal people, we would consider the Hecretary bird a creature with the head of a dog and the body of a bird, but it is not a cenutaur or anything. It's a normal bird(with extraordinary powers).</p>

				<h2>History</h2>
				<hr>
				<h3>Pre-time (subject to change)</h3>
				<p>
					The Hecretary Bird is a legendary bird for a reason, after all. We do not know its true origins, due to dumb ancestors deciding to orally pass down the origin story.
					Because some idoit messed up one word in the perfect story, many adaptations were born, and it can be seen at from different angles.
				</p>
				<h3>R Version</h3>
				<p>
					A few million years after the formation of the Earth, some creatures moved to Earth from a distant planet(at the time, the distant Hecretary Planet, the Distant Snaxe Planet, the Earth, Heaven, and the Underworld were the only things in the Universe). 
					These creatures, known as Hecretary Birds, had been in existence since the time before time. 
					On Earth, they moved to an enchanted island which they named Hecretary. 
					5 days later, other creatures named Snaxii(also in existence since the time before time) came to Earth. 
					However, they were more ambitious than the Hecretary Birds and took over the rest of the Earth. 
					These Snaxii were not genetically diverse and only had 2 species in their genus. 
					The Hecretary Birds wanted to fight back against the Snaxii, but realized they were outnumbered. 
					They decided to wage a proxy war, one where only the Hecretary Leader and Snaxe Leader would fight to the death. 
					The Hecretary leader, Hecrusander the Great, went to meet the Snaxe Leader, The Evil Snaxe, on the Dust Desert. 
					Then, the battle started. The creatures went to war, skillfully maneuvering around Heaven and the Underworld to attack each other. 
					After 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the Evil Snaxe was kicked by a powerful leg of Hecrusander. 
					Before he died and turned into shapeless pulp, however, he used his Time-Stalin powers and laid a single egg. 
					He then un-Time-Stalined the battle and used the last of his energy to bite Hecrusander’s legs. The Evil Snaxe then died. 
					Hecrusander was carried off the battlefield like a hero and returned to his loyal subjects. 
					He died shortly afterward, however, because of weak legs. These weak legs have been found in almost every future H-Bird and are the basis of the Leg-Snapping Syndrome. 
					In the victory celebrations, the H-Birds forgot about the Evil Snaxe’s egg. 
					Surprisingly, this egg hatched into 4 individual major Snaxii, who are the Bing Snake, the Yiper, the Sea Dragon Snaxe, and the iSnaxe. 
					They diversified the Snaxe Evolutionary Tree with many new minor Snaxii, including Sea Snaxii and Sky Snaxii.

				<h2>Controversy</h2>
				<p>As the greatest creature in the universe, there is much controversy to surround the Hecretary Bird.</p>
				<hr>
				<h3>Hector's House</h3>
				<p>Many would believe that the Hecretary Bird's head was photoshopped right out of <a href="#">Hector</a> from <a href="#">Hector's House</a>. This is false.</p>
				<p>Hector's head is very similar to the Hecretary Bird's head, due to it being one of the Hecretary Bird's creations. Hector was one of its first creations, which is why Hector takes the appearance of a dog.</p>
