				<h2>What is the Hecrepedia?</h2>
				<p>The Hecrepedia is a large encyclopedia of a bunch of information related to the Hecretary World, or Hecresphere.</p>
				<p>Many people's skills were used to create this website as well as discover the ancient origins of these 'mythical' beings, which makes this our legacy. Please respect it and pass it down to future generations.</p>
				<p>We are not currently inviting people to our organization, but if you are interested in joining, you need to contact our leader and pass the test that he/she/other gives you.</p>

			<div id="section" class="left">
				<h2>Is this stuff made up?</h2>
				<p>We are proud to say probably not.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="section" class="right">
				<h2>Why is this so informal?</h2>
				<p>Our tech person doesn't have a fancy background in making online encyclopedias, and we are poor.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="section" class="middle">
				<h2>How can you help us?</h2>
				<p>We need to become known, so spread the word. Make people know that this stuff is real and educate yourself as well. </p>
				<p>Other than that, there is nothing else because we don't trust you, and we are very sorry that you are untrustworthy.</p>

				<h2>Birds</h2>
				<p><a href=animals/birds/index.html>Birds</a> are a very prestigious species in the Hecretary world. Know them well so you can be rewarded upon meeting one.</p>

				<h2>Snaxii</h2>
